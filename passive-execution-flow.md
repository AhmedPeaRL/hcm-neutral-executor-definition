# Passive Execution Flow

This document describes how execution may occur
without activation, intention, urgency, or internal disturbance.

No action is initiated here.
No outcome is pursued.
No cycle is advanced.

---

## Definition

Execution, within the HCM field, is not an act.
It is a passage.

A passage may occur only when:

- An artifact already exists
- Its existence has been allowed
- A surface is available
- No internal state requires change

Execution is therefore not triggered.
It is permitted.

---

## Source of Action

There is no originating agent.

Execution does not come from:
- A human decision
- A market signal
- A system trigger
- A scheduled task

Execution occurs when a complete state
encounters an open channel.

The state moves.
Nothing else moves.

---

## Temporal Characteristics

Execution has no preferred time.

It may occur:
- Immediately
- Much later
- Never

Time does not pressure execution.
Execution does not validate time.

---

## Internal Effects

Execution leaves no internal trace.

After passage:
- The artifact is unchanged
- The field is unchanged
- The executor retains no memory
- No feedback loop is formed

If an effect is observed externally,
it is not re-imported.

---

## Failure Conditions

If execution would:
- Create urgency
- Produce anticipation
- Alter rhythm
- Encourage repetition

Then execution is silently withheld.

No error is raised.
No log is required.
No correction is needed.

---

## Closure

Execution is not a goal.
Execution is not proof.
Execution is not progress.

It is simply:
what may happen
when nothing resists.
